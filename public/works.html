                Matrix of Heroes is made from Unity with Shengbuo, Angela, and Lily. We created this game for Defhacks 2020 and won

                This is an Overwatch themed MS Paint like program I built during my Grade 11 Comp Sci Class as a project.

                as well as a built-in music player. This program was made with PyGame.

                This is my vision of the classic Arcade game Tron. Built from Java Swing, the game has Single-Player and Multiplayer mode,
                as well as a built-in scoreboard like the classic one. In addition to the classic gameplay, this version of Tron has explosives
                and time rewind.

            <p>
                This is my adventure to build data structures from scratch. I always wanted to see how each data structure works,
                as well as why they are good at some stuff and bad at others. This project also helped me understand more about
                time and space complexity.
