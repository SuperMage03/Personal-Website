                                </div>

                                <p>
                                    I have followed the custom keyboard for a while before I finally decided to build one myself.
                                    All keyboards I've own prior to my Tofu60 are very annoying to type with and rattly, but most importantly
                                    they were all light and cheap.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="tofu60-build-experience">
                                <h2>Build Experience</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Since this is my first custom keyboard build, there were some tricky stuff like having a consistent
                                    amount of dielectric grease for each switch. But for the most part, it went really well.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Case</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I chose to go with the Tofu60 case from KBDfans. This case is all aluminum, feels sturdy and heavy.
                                    One of the most popular beginner case, it's also compact with only 60% the size of a full size keyboard.
                                    In addition, I added some foam to the case to dampen the sound.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Switch</h3>
                                <div id="tofu60-switch-content">
                                    <p>
                                        I always loved keyboards with tactility but not loud and clicky, this is why I used Zealio V2 as the switch of my first build.
                                        <br><br>
                                        I went with the 62g spring version because it's light to code with and not too fatiguing when gaming.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The switch is also applied with Trbisosy 3204 for better smoothness, it's also filmed with Deskey films to reduce housing wobble for better sounding.
                                    </p>

                                </div>

                                <h3>Plate</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I went with a brass plate because brass plate makes the keyboard sound more clacky and that's what I'm going for.
                                    I also cut some neoprene foam strips and adhere them on the plate to dampen the sound a bit more.
                                </p>

                                <h3>PCB</h3>
                                <p>
                                    For PCB, I went with the DZ60, this PCB is very versatile and cheap, with support of many key layouts as well as easy key programming.
                                    The only downside is that the keys has to be soldered on, which means I have to unsolder switches if I want to replace them.
                                    But, I have a lot of experience with soldering from fixing gaming consoles so that wasn't a big deal for me.
                                </p>
